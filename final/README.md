# PDM LSU CSC2463 Meredith Clark
Dr. Webb and Scott Nelson, Section 1 

	Pursuing Digital Media Arts & Engineering (DMART) minor with a major in Marketing, and a concentration
	in Digital Marketing.


This is my GitHub repository for LSU's CSC 2463 class, and specifically, my Final Integration Project. 
Throughout the course of the semester, we've learned about programming images, sound, and physical computing. 
As the projects progressed, I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone and tried and learn more about the world of coding. This final integration project sums my efforts in becoming proficient in programming digital media.


# Kaleidoscope Keys
Kaleidoscope Keys is an interactive sound program that creates fun, funky shapes on the user's screen, while blinking a light while playing.

See Youtube video of the fully working project: https://youtu.be/pWqWlZeKsSU

	Project Overview:
	Learning from each previous project, I wanted to create a program that was more artistic because I was drawn to the
	graphics unit. I played with these shapes to create 4 entertaining shapes: hearts, octagon, square, and circle. When
	it came to selecting the audio portion of the project, I wanted to create something that would be interactive while
	allowing the graphics to remain the center of the show, should I say. The last piece of the project was to
	integrate Arduino. I created a blinking LED to go along with the computer portion to tie it all toegther.
	
What a screen would look like after 20 seconds of playing with the program would look like, however each fresh of the page is different, so no screen would look the same:

	Future Development:
	As I was designing and coding this project, I had hopes on being able to create a more accurate respresentation of
	what a Kaleidoscope would look like. If I had more time to continue to grow the program, I would like to look into
	controlling the sound by using a potentiometer or photosensor to control the volume, pitch, or echo. In addition,
	I would like to find a way to fade the graphics so the screen isn't fully color the more you play. 
	

I really enjoyed the challenge of creating this program and am proud to publish it to GitHub!
